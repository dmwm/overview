Overview release notes
======================

7.0.0
-----
Initial prototype version of Overview 7, based on WMCore.REST.

Implementation of PhEDEx plots is still only partial; DDT plots use
the old graph server until the new D3-based plotting engine is
complete. Most of the required D3 plotting structure is in place,
requires mainly filling in loads of plotting code for different
graph types, much of which well-documented in D3 tutorials.

Internal documentation is also still lacking.
